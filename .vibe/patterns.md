# Allowed Patterns

> Consistency matters. Use these patterns. Only these patterns.

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

### File Organization
```
✅ DO: [Your existing patterns]
✅ DO: Keep existing structure until Ship #10
✅ DO: Document decisions as you go

❌ DON'T: Refactor everything at once
❌ DON'T: Change file structure mid-ship
❌ DON'T: Break existing patterns without planning
```

## 🚫 Project-Specific Rules

1. **Don't break existing functionality** - Ship #1 rule
2. **Use existing dependencies** until Ship #5
3. **Keep current architecture** until users complain
4. **No major refactors** until Ship #10
5. **Test everything** before shipping

## 📏 Ship Sizes

**Choose the right size:**
- 🟢 **Small (< 4 hours)**: Single component, clear scope
- 🟡 **Medium (4-8 hours)**: Multiple files, one feature  
- 🔴 **Large (> 8 hours)**: STOP! Break into smaller ships
