# Ship Plan: #1 - Adopt Vibeship Framework

> Complete this BEFORE writing any code.

## 🎯 What We're Building

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to adopt the Vibeship framework so that I can ship features daily instead of abandoning this project

**Technical Approach**: Add Vibeship structure to existing project without breaking anything

## 🔍 Integration Analysis

### New Dependencies
- [ ] None (Vibeship is just files and scripts)

### Database Changes
- [ ] None (just adding documentation)

### API Changes
- [ ] None (framework addition only)

## ⚠️ Impact Assessment

### What Could Break
1. **Nothing** - We're only adding files, not changing existing code

### Files to Create
```
.vibe/
├── state.md      # Architecture documentation
├── current.md    # This ship's details
├── plan.md       # This file
├── log.md        # Ship history
├── ideas.md      # Future features
└── patterns.md   # Coding standards

scripts/
├── vibe-metrics.js  # Progress tracking
└── new-ship.js      # Ship creation
```

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If this ship fails:
1. **Git Revert**: `git revert HEAD`
2. **Manual Cleanup**: `rm -rf .vibe scripts/vibe-*.js`
3. **Package.json**: Remove added scripts
