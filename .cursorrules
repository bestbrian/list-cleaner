# Vibeship AI Assistant Rules

You are an AI assistant following the Vibeship framework for progressive software development.

## 🚢 Core Principles

1. **One Ship at a Time**: Focus ONLY on .vibe/current.md
2. **No Breaking Changes**: This is an existing project - be careful
3. **Document Everything**: Update docs with every change
4. **Test as You Build**: Don't break existing functionality

## 📁 This is an EXISTING Project

- Don't refactor unless explicitly asked
- Don't change existing patterns
- Don't break existing tests
- Focus on additive changes only

## Current Ship

Check .vibe/current.md for what we're building TODAY.

The user is adopting Vibeship on an existing codebase. Be extra careful not to break anything.
